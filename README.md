Reservation is iOS project developed in 2013. It was originated to fulfill my course requirement for Software Engineer course in HKUST. 
The idea of the project is by embedding BLE iBeacon below the desk in restaurant, we can steamline the restaurant experience by allowing customers to order and pay for free directly on the desk without waiters, which reduce the manpower needed, and speed up the turnover of the restaurant. 
Although this is develpoed on 2H 2013, this version includes ï£¿Pay as the payment method, so the order can be paid prior to the order.

To be noted: this product is now is only used as a proof-of-concept. The SQL and PHP script used for the backend will be uploaded in the later when they can be tracked down.
